# CS676-Algorithms-For-Data-Science

Repository for storing code for my MS in Data Science course CS676 Algorithms For Data Science at Pace University.

**Course description:** This course focuses on the algorithms needed for data analytics, and has a computational emphasis. Students will develop proficiency in Python and R, as they build algorithms and analyze data. Topics include data reduction: data mapping, data dictionaries, scalable algorithms, Hadoop, and MapReduce; gaining information from data: data visualization, regression modeling, and cluster analysis; and, predictive analytics: k-nearest neighbors, na√Øve Bayes, time series forecasting, and analyzing streaming data.
